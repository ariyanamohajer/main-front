## 📱 Current Icons

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Replace Placeholder Icons**

Currently using placeholder icons. You need to create proper PNG icons:

### Required Icon Sizes:

- `public/icons/icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `public/icons/icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

### How to Create Icons:

1. **Design your app icon** (square, simple design works best)
2. **Export as PNG** in the required sizes
3. **Replace the placeholder files** in `public/icons/`

### Icon Design Tips:

- Use simple, recognizable design
- Avoid text (hard to read on small sizes)
- Use your brand colors
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Make sure it looks good when rounded (iOS style)

## 🚀 Deployment Requirements

1. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs only work over HTTPS
2. **Recommended Hosting**:
   - ✅ Vercel (automatic HTTPS)
   - ✅ Netlify (automatic HTTPS)

   - ✅ GitHub Pages

### Quick Deploy Commands:

```bash
